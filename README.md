2. Go to the download folder and open `com.dms.streamdeck.github.streamDeckPlugin`.
3. Drag the "View Requested Reviews" Action to one of the Dials.

## Usage

Once the plugin starts the main display on the touch screen will show you the number of currently Open PRs, this is the "Home Screen".
You may now engage with the Dial:
- **Rotating** the dial will navigate over: Home Screen <-> Individual PRs... <-> ALL <-> Home Screen
- **Pressing the dial** will open: the PR list page, the desired PR or ALL (in individual tabs)

[//TODO]: # (- **Pressing the Touch Screen** will auto-switch you back to the Home Screen)
[//TODO]: # (- **Long Pressing** will trigger a reload)
